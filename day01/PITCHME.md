# Intro to Programming

#### Unit 1 Day 1 - What is Programming?
---
## Do Now

Come up with a task that can be done within the classroom. Write down directions for how to do it
---
## Core Concepts

* The nature of programming
* Working with pseudocode
* Flowcharts
---
## Programming

* A series of detailed directions
* What are some non-computer based things that could be seen as programming?
---
## Computerless Programming

Find your partner. I'll give each person 3 minutes to direct their partner on how to accomplish their task, then we'll switch.
---
## Pseudocode

* Simplified way of describing an algorithm
* Write out each step of the program & indent lines that are dependent on the line before
---
<pre>
wake up
check day
if day is equal to Saturday or Sunday
    go back to sleep
else
    check time
    if time is later than 7 AM
        get out of bed
        brush teeth
        get dressed
        go to school
    else go back to sleep
</pre>
---
<pre>
initialize students as list of student names
for each student name in students
    print "hello <student name>"
</pre>
---
<pre>
if student's grade is greater than or equal to 65
    print "pass"
else
    print "fail"
</pre>

## Flowcharts

* Diagram showing an algorithm or process
* Different shapes have different meanings
* Five main shapes
---
## Process

* Rectangle
* A single step
* Any number of paths in
* Single path out
---
## Decision

* Diamond
* Yes/No question
* Any number of paths in
* Two paths out
---
## Terminator

* Rectangle with rounded ends
* Start or end a process
* One path out (if start)
* Any number of paths in (if end)
---
## Data I/O

* Parallelogram
* Input or output of data
* Any number of paths in
* One path out
---
## Predefined process

* Rectangle with vertical bars on sides
* Refers to a process defined in another spreadsheet
---
## Flowcharts

Try it together: How could we write a flowchart for determining whether a number is even or odd?
---
# SGO Pre-assessment
---
## Directions

* Create pseudocode and a flowchart for generating and displaying each number in the fibonacci sequence that is not > 500
---
## Evaluation

* Exercise (graded as complete, partially complete, or inadequate/no effort)
* Will get feedback as if it were classwork
---
## Submitting Work

* Put in folder for your class
---
## Remember to get your AUP signed
