## Intro to Programming

#### Day 24 - Introduce Version Control
---
# Version Control
---
# What is it?

* Version control keeps track of your files and changes to them
* Enables you to have different versions without saving multiple copies
---
# Why does it matter?

* Collaborating on documents is easier
* Very hard to lose work
* Can have different versions existing simultaneously
---
# Git
